## 🔍 Stock Scanner

Pattern detection system that scans tickers for breakout patterns and generates analysis reports.

**Scan all tickers:**
```bash
python stock_scanner/scanner.py
```

**Test a single ticker:**
```bash
python stock_scanner/test_single_ticker.py TICKER
```

**Backtest historical suggestions:**
```bash
python stock_scanner/analyze_results.py
```

This validates past scanner suggestions by calculating actual returns, hit rates, and score correlation using real market data. Results are saved to `reports/backtest_summary.csv` and visualized in the Backtest Analytics dashboard.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All scanner parameters, thresholds, and scoring algorithms are controlled via `config/settings.yaml`.
